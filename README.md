## Installing the Vagrant Setup
We will be using a Vagrant box that will come pre-installed with Python and the MySQL server. The set of tools that are needed are as follows:
- *VirtualBox*: is a virtual machine monitor that allows you to, in simple terms, install another operating system and prebuilt software on your current OS.
- *Vagrant*: is a tool that can create and configure development environments for virtual machines. This basically allows you to install and distribute your configurations of installations of different software like Python, MySQL, mongoDB, etc.

### Mac/Linux and Windows
Follow this instructions from the SQL to Python Beginner Project on installing VirtualBox and Vagrant. Click on the link for your operating system: [Windows](https://github.com/ADSA-UIUC/Resources/blob/master/dev-environment/vagrant/windows-setup.md) or [Mac OS X/Linux](https://github.com/ADSA-UIUC/Resources/blob/master/dev-environment/vagrant/mac-setup.md).
